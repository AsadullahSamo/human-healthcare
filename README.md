## Trade-offs and Decisions

### 1. State Management
- **Decision**: Minimal Redux usage due to simple state requirements
- **Rationale**: Most state is component-local; Redux setup ready for future scaling

### 2. Styling Approach
- **Decision**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Rationale**: Rapid development with consistent design tokens

### 3. Dark Mode
- **Decision**: Light theme only per project requirements
- **Rationale**: Brand consistency and user preference

### 4. Content Strategy
- **Decision**: Used actual Human Healthcare content and services
- **Rationale**: Real-world data provides better UX than placeholder content

### 5. Form Validation
- **Decision**: Zod + React Hook Form
- **Rationale**: Type-safe validation with excellent DX

## Content Assumptions

- **Company Information**: Actual Human Healthcare business details
- **Services**: Real healthcare services offered in Karachi
